Add ]m/[m support for more languages

# About

Based on [Andrew Radev's awesome Stack Overflow
answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/6855438/79125), this plugin improves
`]m`/`[m` support for C#, Java, and C++.

It also uses [bybor answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/25521838/79125) to use
OmniSharp support, if available.
